# Software Engineer Programming Evaluation 
*(Excerpt )*
## Intent:

The purpose is to evaluate your style of programming, problem solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and overall understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as it relates to the software development process.  Utilization of these skills during this process will weigh more heavily than the final result produced.
## Instructions:
1. Pick one question to complete that will best demonstrate your style of programming, problem solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and overall understanding of OOP. 
2. While we are not tracking speed to complete, the expected time frame for this test is under four hours.
3. If you are applying for a web developer position, write your solution in Javascript and leverage whichever external libraries or frameworks you feel you need. 
## Pool of Questions (Select One):

### 1.	String Encryption

Develop an application to “encrypt” a string.  Present the user a ‘main menu’ of 2 options:  1) Select string encryption method; 2) Exit. 

When the user chooses option 1, the program then requests the encryption method:  A, B, or C. When one of those choices in entered, the program requests the string to “encrypt”. The string is encrypted based on the selected method as shown below, and then the encrypted string will be printed followed by the original string. The main menu is then displayed again. 

The program exits when the user chooses the option 2.

	Method A:  Replace the string with all 'X's.
	Method B:  Replace each char with the char one higher on the ASCII table.
	Method C:  Replace each char with the 3 next highest chars on the ASCII table.

# Technical Specs README
## Skill Screen Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
